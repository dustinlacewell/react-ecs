`react-ecs` is a declarative "Entity Component System" for React.

## What's that?

An **ECS**, or _Entity Component System_ is a design pattern popular in game development. It eschews rich objects for simple **Entities** that compose data-only Components, or **Facets** as `react-ecs` calls them (to avoid confusion with React Components).

Logic is then handled by small update functions called **Systems** that operate upon the facets related to it.

In the example to the right, a common scenario is illustrated. There are a number of entities, comprised merely as a collection of simple data facets. A `Velocity` or `Position` component may hold a simple vector. Whereas a `Graphics` component might hold the URL of a sprite image.

Two systems, `PhysicsSystem` and `GraphicsSystem` are responsible for all the behavior and logic:

-   The `PhysicsSystem` looks at all the entities with **both** `Velocity` and `Position` facets, using the former to update the latter.
-   The `GraphicsSystem` looks at all the entities with **both** `Position` and `Graphics` facets, using the former to draw the latter.

The systems ignore the entities that don't have the facets they're interested in.

## Composition over Inheritance

ECS takes "composition over inheritance" to its logical conclusion.

Entities are nothing more than their facets. They don't have their own data and they don't have any code.

There's no need to try to find the best inheritance tree to represent your problem domain.

Just slap some useful facets onto some entities and write some systems to process them. This also means entity capabilities can dynamically change at runtime.

It's a robust, easy to implement pattern that can enable a fun creativity.

## Declarative ECS with React

The idea behind `react-ecs` is to allow you to _describe_ the parts of your ECS in standard React fashion:

First, define some useful Facets.

```tsx
class Mass extends Facet<Mass> {}

class Lifetime extends Facet<Lifetime> {
    timeleft? = 1;
}

class Position extends Facet<Position> {
    location? = new Vector2(0, 0);
}

class Velocity extends Facet<Velocity> {
    amount? = new Vector2(0, 0);
}
```

Let's add a system to remove entities when their `Lifetime` has expired:

```tsx
const LifetimeSystem = () => {
    // get reference to ECS engine
    const engine = useEngine();
    // create a query for entities with the Lifetime face
    const query = useQuery((e) => e.has(Lifetime));

    // create a system that runs every tick
    return useSystem((dt: number) => {
        // use the query to loop over entities with the Lifetime facet
        query.loop([Lifetime], (e, [lifetime]) => {
            // subtract the current frame time
            lifetime.timeleft -= dt;

            // remove entity from engine if it expires
            if (lifetime.timeleft <= 0) {
                engine.removeEntity(e);
            }
        });
    });
};
```

Let's add a couple of other systems for moving entities around:

```tsx
const PhysicsSystem = () => {
    const query = useQuery((e) => e.hasAll(Position, Velocity));

    return useSystem((dt) => {
        query.loop([Position, Velocity], (e, [pos, vel]) => {
            pos.location = pos.location.clone().add(vel.amount);
        });
    });
};

const GravitySystem = ({ vector }) => {
    const query = useQuery((e) => e.hasAll(Mass, Velocity));

    return useSystem((dt) => {
        query.loop([Velocity], (e, [vel]) => {
            vel.amount = vel.amount
                .clone()
                .add(vector.clone().multiplyScalar(dt));
        });
    });
};
```

Finally, let's write a system to sync an entity's `Position` facet with its standard `DOMView` facet:

```tsx
const DOMViewSystem = () => {
    const query = useQuery((e) => e.hasAll(DOMView, Position));

    return useSystem((dt) => {
        query.loop([DOMView, Position], (e, [view, pos]) => {
            // sync DOM element's style with entity's Position
            view.element.style.left = `${pos.location.x}px`;
            view.element.style.top = `${pos.location.y}px`;
        });
    });
};
```

Now we can put it all together:

```tsx
export const DOMParticles = () => {
    // create the ECS
    const ECS = useECS();
    // update the ECS every frame
    useAnimationFrame(ECS.update);

    // some helper functions for randomizing things
    const rnd = (s: number) => Math.random() * s - s * 0.5;
    const randomVector = (s: number) =>
        new Vector2(rnd(s), rnd(s));


    return (
        <ECS.Provider> {/* context provider for ECS things */}
            {/* include all the systems */}
            <LifetimeSystem />
            <PhysicsSystem />
            <GravitySystem vector={new Vector2(0, 10)} />
            <DOMViewSystem />

            {/* emit entities with a delay using built-in <Emitter /> */}
            <Emitter emissionDelay={0.025}>
                {() => {
                    // create random position
                    const pos = randomVector(50).add(new Vector2(250, 100));
                    return (
                        {/* <Entity> contains all its facets */}
                        <Entity>
                            <Mass />
                            <Lifetime timeleft={3} />
                            <Position location={pos} />
                            <Velocity amount={randomVector(10)} />
                            <DOMView> {/* DOMView's child lets us declare how the entity looks */}
                                <img
                                    style={{
                                        position: 'absolute',
                                        left: pos.x,
                                        top: pos.y,
                                        width: 16,
                                        height: 16
                                    }}
                                    src="https://i.imgur.com/kFjaH5l.png" />
                            </DOMView>
                        </Entity>
                    );
                }}
            </Emitter>
        </ECS.Provider>
    )
}
```
